I have tried to make it easy to use and test ooolib-python.  In the examples/
directory you will find sample code that can be executed to generate sample ODF
document.

Additionally, you can install ooolib-python using the setup.py script.  For
installation execute the following command:

bash# ./setup.py install

As long as you have root access you should be able to install the ooolib-python
package and use it throughout your system.
