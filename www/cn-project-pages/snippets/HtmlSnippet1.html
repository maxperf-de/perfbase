<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />                   		<p> Are you tired of importing your benchmark results into some spreadsheet software to do to calculations with the data? Confused by the zillions of output files gathered from various benchmarks on different platforms? Bored of going through the same hassle again and again to create meaningful plots from your data? No way for simple and secure collaboration when gahering and analysing performance data? Then perfbase is for you. </p><p> Achieving correctness and/or the desired performance with application software, middleware or operating system components is an important, but complex task. A high-dimensional parameter space has to be considered when running the correctness tests. For performance tests, it has to be reduced to a small number of core parameters, which influence the performance most significantly. In either case, a large number of test runs is necessary to determine if a software works correctly, or how the best performance can be achieved. Keeping track of such experiments and their results(!) to derive the correct conclusions is a major task. </p><p> 'perfbase' is a set of front end tools using a PostgreSQL database as backend, which together form a system for the management and analysis of the output of tests and experiments. In this context, an experiment is an execution of an application or library on a computer system. The output of such an experiment are one or more text files containing information on the execution of the  application. This output is the input for 'perfbase' which extracts specified information to store it in the database and make it available for management and analysis purposes in a consistent, fast and flexible manner over a long period of time. 'perfbase' explicitely supports multi-user usage with a role-based permission scheme.                </p>
