This test uses the SQL dataype "version_nbr", which is not a standard
datatype with PostgreSQL. Instead, it is a user-defined datatype 
provided by perfbase. To make this test pass, you need to build
the according library and install it in PostgreSQL's default library 
directory (see pgsql/version_datatype).
