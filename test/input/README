This test verifies that the 'input' command parses the arguments
correctly. The focus is on the processing of multiple input files
and multiple input descriptions. But this test does also check 
the input parsing for a command-line provided synopsis.

Test 1: data from a single input file, single input description
        => single run will be created

Test 2: data for two runs from a single input file, single input
        description 
        => two runs to be created
 
Test 3: two input files and a single input description
        => two runs will be created

Test 4: two input files and two input descriptions
        => a single run will be created
