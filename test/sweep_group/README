This test verifies the correctness and also shows the application of the 
"sweep_group" attribute for <combiner> elements. This allows you to specify
which variations of a sweep, which are fed into the combiner as individual
data streams, should be grouped (merged) back into a single data stream. 
The content of the sweep_group-attribute is the ID of a <sweep>ed parameter
element, and all data streams that differ by this parameter, but are identical
by all other parameters will be grouped.

To understand the effect, it is best to call "make demo" and look at the 
different query files and the resulting .ps files.
