This test performs access control verification. Therefore, database users have
to be created and deleted which requires sufficient rights on the database 
server for the user that performs these tests, and the server needs to be 
configured in a way to allow connections from these new users without passwords.

The simplest way to achieve this is to edit pg_hba.conf and provide a line like:
host    all         all             127.0.0.1         255.255.255.255   trust

This will allow all users from the local host to connect without password.
