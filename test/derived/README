Test the processing of 'derived parameters'.

NOTE: the file input_1.dat.bug is an alternative input file for the
test #1 (which uses input_1.dat). Using this input, the value '1.9' in
the final row will be stored as 1.89 in the database. Additionally,
for the output of the query, we have obbserved that this value will be
printed as 1.89 or 1.88. This is probably caused by different Python
version - the exact cause is unknown to us. To test with this input
file, just rename it to input_1.dat.
