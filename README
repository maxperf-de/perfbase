This is 'perfbase', a Python-based SQL tool-set to manage and analyse 
scientific experiments. It is based on advanced processing of plain-text 
input files, generated by the experiments, to extract the relevant data.
This data is then managed using a database for further analysis,
visualization and further processing.

For information on the installation of perfbase, please refer to README.INSTALL.

For more information on its usage, refer to the documentation
in the 'doc' directory. Some easy-to-follow examples are provided in the
'examples' directory. The 'test' directory contains a regression test suite
which gives additional usage examples. Up-to-date information on perfbase is 
available via the project page http://perfbase.tigris.org.
