This file lists the changes between releases in reverse chronological order.

Marking of items denotes category of change (may be combined):
+ added feature or component
x bug fix
~ changed behaviour
# break of XML backward compatibility
- other changes

Following the marking is the affected command(s) or file(s), then the actual 
change description.

RELEASE 1.0.1 (?, ? ? ?)
x query: avoid '/' characters from filenames being created with 'unify="filter"' attribute
+ query: microsecond units are properly printed with gnuplot (greek symbol)
x check: fix invalid use of 'autocommit' for database vacuum
x update: fix exception when appending <valid> values to a parameter

RELEASE 1.0.0 (Fri, April 9th 2010)
+ input: implemented <match> element for <tabular_values> 
+ input: if neither a <match> nor a <pos> element is specified for a <tabular_values>,
  then it will parse the next data element (to the right) relative to the previous
  <tabular_value>. Useful for tables with a variable layout.
x query: using a query that is stored in the database now works
~ query: parameter contents of blind sweeps is now sorted (in ascending order)
x attach: missing experiment name handled properly 
+ check: database index counters are fixed (sometimes necessary for datatabases that
  have been dumped & restored)
x query: a query element would store it's data only once, even if different storage
  targets are requested through the structure of the query. This could result in "empty"
  query results i.e. in conjunction with the "sort" operator.
+ query: improved handling options for multiple data streams created by one or 
  more <sweeps> result in better output (plots). See test/sweep_group/README.
x query: "sweep_resolve=extern" for <output> objects did not work correctly (created only
  a single output element instead of N)
- perfbase: line counting is more reliable now (contributed by Patrick Ohly)
+ query: the sort operator now accepts an arbitrary number of keys for sorting 
  like 'value="x,y,z"' (contributed by Patrick Ohly)
x input: set_separation now also works with <regexp> matching (contributed by Patrick Ohly)
~ query: always specify 'using ..:..' to gnuplot which is needed to plot timevalues
  (contributed by Patrick Ohly)
+ query: support the creation of OpenDocument spreadsheets. This works in a smart way 
  for various combinations of filters, parameter values and result values, but not 
  for all possible queries. For details, see test/opendoc.
x setup: <..._access> elements in experiment description now work as expected
+ check: checking for and removing stray runs with "check -f" command
+ query: new attribute "style=value" for <parameter> makes only the value name appear
  in the filter string. Useful in combinatin with "alias=..." for <value>.
+ query: quantile operator now supports float numbers in "value" attribute - necessary to
  determine the 99.9% percentile. Before, the "value" attribute was interpreted as
  integer.
+ query: distribution plots (histograms) now show the probabilty in real 
  percentage values ("80%" instead of "0.8")
+ input: improve data import flexibility by supporting updates of value sets within a run
  (see test/set_update)
+ query: add new 'showstyle="toogle"' attribute for boolean parameters (toggles visibility
  of value name)
x query: properly support zero result with count operator
+ query: 'option' attribute for count operator allows to chose between "float" and "integer"
  result datatype
+ query: combiner element supports the conversion of a result vector into a paramter vector
  (see test/combstrip)
+ query: added new operator type 'frequency' which calculates the frequency at which data points
  show up (see test/frequency)
+ query: added new operator type 'normalize' which scales/offsets a vector based on its first
  element (see test/normalize)
+ query: support individual plot types and styles for the <input>s of a single <output> element
  via attributes 'style' and 'type' for each <input> element
- general: adapted to psycopg2 - no need to install the outdated version 1 any longer
- general: test suite updated, and some minor issues fixed, passes for Python 2.6 and PostgreSQL 8.4
- general: 'python' subdirectory removed as its content is no longer relevant

RELEASE 0.9.5 (Wed, 13th September 2006)
+ query: the query description can now be read from stdin like: 
 'create_query | perfbase query -d -'
x query: index error for gnuplot output when data from different <source>s with 
  different numbers of filter strings (for the label) are plotted into a single 
  chart
+ input: it is now possible to assign content to a parameter A based on the content
  of parameter B (see example in test/map2)
# input: 'mode="set"' is depreciated now (warning is given); use 'store_set="yes"'
  instead. Reason: 'set' is not mutually exclusive with the other possible values
  for this attribute.
x query: aggregation (i.e. max) for an empty vector that was generated by another 
  operator (not a source) caused an invalid SQL clause.
+ query: filter string/text data by regular expressions using the <regexp> filter
# update: experiment name needs to be specified via <experiment>, not via <name> (for
  consistency with other description formats)
~ query: for a parameter filter "IS NULL" and style="content", nothing is shown for the
  label (before, "P = NULL"  was printed)
x query: label generation fixed for data input with a different number of label sub-strings
  (sub-strings could disappear before)
+ added perfbase_manual.pdf to the distribution (generated from perfbase_docbook.xml)
+ added binary version of the SQL version number library
x input: definition of empty strings as <valid> strings caused error in input
x query: boolean values with occurence=multiple would cause SQL exception in certain cases
~ version datatype: Makefile is generate by configure script now; this should fill in the
  correct pathes
x restore: strip pathname from automatically determined experiment name 
+ info: option --xml dumps content of attached XML files
x attach: fixed typo in help & fixed bug for verbose listing of attachments w/o description
+ query: operators 'median' and 'quantile' now support the attribute 'variant': 'lower' 
  (default) gives the boundary for the lower X% of the values, while 'upper' gives the
  boundary for the upper X%.
+ input: data can now be scaled on import using the attibute "scale". Useful to convert
  between differet units in the experiment and input file. Implemented for 
  <named_location> and <tabular_value>
x improved exception handling
x query: fixed SQL construction for 'contain' and 'match' <filter> expressions
~ input: increased robustness for parsing corrupted input files
x query: catch the case of a "blind <sweep>" that fails if no data is available for this 
  parameter
+ query: reduction operators can now be used with "run" scope (attribute "scope" set to "run)
  which will perform the reduction for each run, instead of doing a global reduction
  on all runs (with parameter-set matching). See test/scope.
x testsuite: added workaround for "false failed alerts" in testsuite which are caused by differing 
  data orders of different PostgreSQL versions (do a second diff with sorted output files).
  With this workaround, no errors should be reported in the testsuite no matter which version 
  of PostgreSQL is used.
x find: added missing parentheses to avoid that false matches are delivered

RELEASE 0.9.1 (Fri, 30th June 2006)
x setup: installation of version datatype was broken due to invalid return value 
  specification
x restore: experiments which used custom SQL datatypes ('version_nbr') failed to restore
  correctly.
x update: adding/changing multiple users/groups in an update description failed (only 
  the first entry was evaluated)
- query: removed duplicate creation of tics for gnuplot output
- further worked on the documentation (XML docbook)

RELEASE 0.9.0 (Wed, 24th May 2006)
~ query: improved the generation of parameter filter labels for operators which have 
  two or more <input>s: only labels that *every* input provides are passed up. This 
  avoids irritating information of parameter filters.
~ query: the unified output filenames (attribute 'unify="filter"' for 'filename' element)
  now appends the filter strings in a strict order. This makes it easier to differentiate
  the filenames.
+ query: setting the attribute 'unify' to 'fixed' in the 'filename' element will 
  replace all '(id)' within the specified filename with the content of 'fixed'
  elements with this id. (also see new feature below)
+ query: most strings, including attribute content, can now be customized on run-time of the
  query via "macros". A macro looks like '(id)' (an id string within parentheses). If the
  id string is the id of a <fixed> object, the macro will be replaced with the content
  of the <fixed> object. See the queries in examples/auto_compare/PMB.
- added new example auto_compare, which contains two sub-examples for (semi-)automatic
  performance comparison: PMB (Pallas MPI Benchmark, aka IMB), and NPB (NAS Parallel 
  Benchmarks). A preprint of a poster abstract concerning this technique has been added
  as doc/preprint_europvmmpi2006.pdf
- added new example for processing 'iozone' benchmark output
- query: performance optimization by having query object that provide data to N other
  objects store this (read-only) data only in *one* table (read by all N other objects)
  instead of storing the same data in N different tables.
x query: completed support of attribute 'label' for input objects in operators
~ input: if no content could be found for a value, or if no input definiton was found
  for a value, the valid content is now also printed (if applicable)
+ undelete: finally, deleted runs can now be un-deleted using this command.
+ check: the new option --index=... allows to create an additional index in the run 
  data table for arbitrary values with multiple occurenc This can significantly speed 
  up queries which filter for this value.
+ delete: parameters sets can now be deleted
+ query: the attribute "unit" with values "on" or "off" controls the display of 
  the unit (see below). Default is "on".
~ query: the unit of a parameter value used as a filter is now also displayed in 
  the output
+ query: "style" attribute now supports the values "on_off" and "yes_no". They can
  be used to print filters for boolean parameters in a more intuive way. I.e., 
  using "on_off" for a parameter value name "prefetch" will show "prefetch off"
  or "prefetch on" in the output, depending on the boolean filter condition.
~ query: a <series> object can now also be placed outside a <source> object to be
  referenced via <input>
x find: wrong SQL query was created if only filtering by the synopsis
x check: option '--all' was disfunctional (plus some other minor changes)
~ info: when printing all run indexes (option '--inventory'), this list is sorted now.
+ all commands now support the option '--sqltrace' which will print all SQL command
  string sent to the database server
+ query: added operator type 'round' to round floating point data. The attrbute
  'value' is used to specify the number of decimal places.
~ the internal database format was changed: all data for the runs which is of 
  type "occurrence=multiple" is now stored in a single table. This speeds up
  some functionality sigificantly, esp. with a large number of runs. Before, 
  a new table was created for every run, and each table required a separate
  query in some cases. This didn't scale very well.
  The database format version has been bumped to '5'. A 'perfbase check -u' will
  transform existing databases into the new format without loosing any data.
  NOTE: Because the new database format requires different SQL query statements,
  it is possible that the order of the data returned by a query does change 
  (i.e. is reversed). This can be fixed from within the query either by the 
  attributes 'order' and 'key' of the <source> object, or via a 'sort' operator
  (the first being faster, the latter being more powerful). However, the changed
  order does not matter if data is plotted, only for text or table ouptut.
+ input: a named_location may now have the attribute 'mode="abort"' which will 
  abort an input operation when matched. Useful for automatic import of different
  data files into the same experiment.
+ input: until now, all files to be imported have been read into memory completely
  for this operation. Now, arbitrarily sized files can be imported due to the
  introduction of a (simple) cached-access technique. For very large files, the
  input performance is at about 600 lines/s on a single Pentium4 2GHz.
x find: exception caused by using wrong case for names of values to be printed.
x find: exception caused when no "show" or "value" parameter was provided
+ query: two new ways to print parameter filters (attribute 'style')
# query (parameter): content 'value' of attribute 'style' changed to 'content' to 
  make naming consistent.  
# query (combiner): attribute name 'exclude' changed to 'omit' to avoid confusion
  with 'input'
# query: the attribute 'sweep_combine' is now an attribute of <combiner> and
  <operator>, not of <input> any more.
+ query: redesigned parsing of query description. Now, it is also possible to 
  use a <combiner> as input for an <operator>. Next to this, broken inter-element
  references within unreferenced objects do no longer cause an error.
+ query: the attributes "sweep_resolve" and "sweep_combine" now also work for 
  <input> elements within <operators>, which allows for simpler query design when 
  using <sweeps> (see test/sweep/sweep_qry_5.xml).
~ examples/mpptest: updated the query for better gnuplot output
+ query: new operators "limit" and "abslimt" allow to filter data streams for 
  thresholds. Useful to i.e. show only deviations larger than a specified noise
  level. See test/limit.
x query: adapted some SQL expressions to PostgreSQL versions >= 8.1 (it is no
  longer valid to use "SELECT table.column"; instead, it is necessary to use
  "SELECT column FROM table", or "SELECT table.column FROM table". Whyever...
x query (gnuplot output): only those data streams from <input> elements which 
  actually provide data will be plotted. Avoids potential confusion (i.e. for labels).
+ query (gnuplot output): creating 3-dimensional plots with gnuplot is now supported.
  See test/plot3d and examples/PMB for examples.
+ query: new attribute 'axislabel' allow to specify, well, the label that will be 
  printed on an axis of a parameter/result (see examples/PMB/pmb_query_3d.xml)
+ input: multi-line text import improved: next to the 'lines' attribute which allows
  import of a fixed (known) number of lines, the new 'marker' attribute for the 
  <match> element allows to import text between a "begin" and "end" marker. See
  test/marker for examples. (Thanks to Andrew Friedley <afriedle@open-mpi.org>)
+ query (xml output): XML was added as a new output format. See test/xml. 
  (Thanks to Andrew Friedley <afriedle@open-mpi.org>)
x query: resolving "open parameters" (<parameter> elements with no <filter> or 
  <sweep> elements) now works as it should. For an example, see test/xml.
x input/query: properly escaping of '-character in strings which are used to build
  SQL statements (see test/marker and test/input) 
x find: version numbers in find conditions get properly quoted now
+ check: when fixing a database, check will now also look for inconsistently added 
  values and will ask to remove them. This may occur if an update operation has been
  interrupted (it can not be performed all in one transaction).
+ info: option --value=<v> allows to print information on a specific parameter or 
  result value. <v> is a regular expression to match the name of the value; thus, to
  display all values, provide an empty <v> ("--value="). The switch -v controls the
  verbosity of the output.

RELEASE 0.8.0 (Thu, 2nd Feb 2006)
+ input, attach: if a single dash (´-´) is given as synopsis or description, the
  respective command will read the real text from stdin. Example:
  perfbase input -s - -d input.xml data.txt
+ find: implemented this command. For now, XML parsing is not yet implemented, but
  most functionality can also be accessed via the command line arguments.
x check: updating the database version now works also when multiple version numbers
  have to be covered (i.e. from 2 to 4). Data was never corrupted!
+ query: new operator types 'slice' has been introduced. It allows to select 
  a subset of runs from all runs matching the parameter filters of a query. An 
  example is the case where multiple runs have been stored with the same contents 
  of all parameter values. However, you know that want to see only data from, say,
  the latest of these runs in a query. It would be possible to specify this run 
  explicitely by its run index of timestamp. However, you'd have to change the 
  query after adding another run which you want to see. The 'slice' allows to
  select i.e. the last one of the chronologically sorted data of all runs. See
  test/slice for some example applications.
+ query: new operator types 'oldest' and 'latest' are convenience operators for
  special applications of the 'slice' operator.
+ query: new attribute 'chronology' for <source> element determines how the runs
  that fit the parameters are sorted: either by the creation timestamp ("created"),
  which is the default, or by the timestamp when the run was performed ("performed").
+ query: new operators 'runindex' and 'param'. 'runindex' delivers the index of the 
  run from which a data element of a result vector was taken. Thus, it transforms
  a result vector with any kind of data into a vector of run indices. The 'param'
  operator in turn transforms a vector of run indices into the content of any
  only-once parameter of the according run. Together, these two operators allow
  for very convenient optimization as it is easily possible to determine which 
  setting of a parameter gives the desired (max. or min.) results. See test/runindex
  for a sample application.
+ perfbase now provides a new scalar SQL data type 'version_nbr' to handle software
  versions correctly. To install the new data type, go to pgsql/version_datatype and
  follow the instructions in README. A testcase is provided in test/version.
~ update: The new update command replaces the somewhat strange "setup -u" way to modify
  an existing enviroment.
+ query: combiner objects do now accept an arbitrary number of input objects (instead
  of only 2); added related test in test/combiner
+ query: attribute 'alias' can now be used for result and parameter elements to specify
  a different name to be used for output (test/combiner also tests for this). Thanks to
  Jesper L. Träff for this suggestion.
+ input: it is now possible to use an arbitrary number of parameter sets with the
  pset-use option. Priority of parameters which are defined in more than one parameter
  set is that the first definition (in the order of the parameter sets on the command 
  line) is used. Thanks to Pavel Shamis for this suggestion.
+ input: the new attribute 'lines' for a named location does allow to store one or
  more lines of text as content for a value. See test/lines for more info. Thanks to 
  Andrew Friedly for this suggestion.
x query: fixed a problem with the runindex operator which could provide the wrong
  runindex if different datasets had some identical content for a value.
- added README.DOCUMENTATION and removed old & imcomplete Word .doc files
# setup: fixed typo with 'occurrence' attribute ('rr' instead of 'r'). However, for
  backward compatibility, the old-style 'occurence' is still understood. Thanks to 
  Sam Lang for pointing this out.

RELEASE 0.7.8a (Thu, 15th Dec 2005)
+ info: show attached XML input and query descriptions in verbose mode
x query: boolean relations in <filter> expressions now work correctly. I.e.
    <filter boolean="or">
      <equal>100</equal>
      <greater>1000</greater>
    </filter>
   will atually match if value==100 or value>1000. Also, the filter description
   strings are now build correctly. Also see test/filter.
~ query: new strategy when formatting strings for gnuplot's enhanced font rendering
  considerig the "meta chars" '_' for subscript and '^' for superscript:
  - if a word contains a single "meta char", the affected substring will be
    put in parenthesis (as usual). Example: 'S_msg' -> 'S_{msg}'
  - if a word contains a multiple "meta chars", they will be escaped as gnuplot
    can not handle such a case, and because this is usually not what the user
    wanted anyway. Example: 'MPI_File_write' -> 'MPI\_File\_write'
x pb_query.dtd: multiple conditions within a single filter are allowed.

RELEASE 0.7.8 (Tue, 13th Dec 2005)
~ info: Improved readability of 'info' output for content of only-once 
  parameters and results and for the names of the input files
~ info: Option '-v' is no longer used with 'info -r' command to specify how much 
  information on a run is printed. 
+ info: New option '--data' for 'info' command allows to specify which data (if 
  any) should be shown of a run.
+ input: If an input description for one or more values is missing, each of these
  values is now printed on a separated line together with its default content
  (if any). This improves readability and makes it easier to decide if it is 
  safe to use default content for these values.
+ input, query: multiple instances of the '-f'/'--fixed=' options can now be joined
  as comma-separated lists, like: '-f a=1 -f b=2 ' into '-f a=1,b=2'
x input: empty input files are now processed "correctly" w/o exceptions. Of course,
  all empty input files have the same hash value 0.
x query: plotting without a title and label-type "title" caused an exception
~ setup script: setup aborts if no 'pidof' command is found either in the PATH
  or in /sbin, /bin, /usr/sbin.
# input: the 'retrigger' attribute for a <named_location> is set to "auto" by 
  default. This means that by default, content for only-once values is only stored 
  once per run: the content of the first trigger. Subsequent triggers are 
  ignored unless the 'retrigger="yes"' attribute is specified (example in
  test/update/update_inp.xml for the input_2.dat input file).
# input: the hash generation for the imported files has been vastly improved - up
  to a factor of 1000. However, this caused a compatibility break for the generated
  hash values: the new algorithm creates different hash values for the same file.
  This means that the input command will eventually re-import files that already
  have been imported as it does create a different hash value.
  Also see doc/performance.txt for more information on this optimisation.
+ input: option '--join' will merge all input files into a single virtual file (in 
  the order of how they are listed on the command line). This allows to use
  multiple files with a single XML description to create a single run.
+ input: option '--sequential' can be used when multiple input description and
  input files are used to create a single run. Normally, data would be gathered
  from all files in "parallel" to allow a dataset to contain data from more than
  one file. If this behaviour is not desired, the new option enforces "sequential"
  processing of all input description/file combinations.
+ new command 'attach': Using the 'attach' command, XML files for input and query
  descriptions can now be stored within the experiment database (called "attachments").
  The 'input' and 'query' commands can use these descriptions directly - just 
  specify their names using the '--name' option (instead of the '--desc' option 
  which specifies a file name). See test/attach for some examples. This feature
  simplifies the management and also the collaboration between multiple users of
  an experiment because they no longer need to have access to a common file system
  to use the same input and query descriptions.

RELEASE 0.7.5 (Fri, 4 Nov 2005)
+ Filters can now also displayed as "value" only, instead of "name = value". 
  This is i.e. useful for string parameters where the value alone is meaningful 
  enough. Use the "style" attribute of <parameter> to control this.
~ Label style "title" can now also be used without the "filterstring" attribute 
  of <output>. In this case, the related part of the label is simply appended 
  to the title string as "(x=y, a=b)"
~ Synopsis for "pair" operator (division and substraction) is now created as 
  "synopsis1 - synopsis2" (for substraction)
x NULL default values now work for only-once values, too. See test/default.
+ fontsize attribute for <output> allows to set, well, the font size
  in generated plots
+ data can now be sorted within a query. Either directly at the source with the
  first parameter as index (attribute "order"), or fully flexible with the new
  'sort' operator for which the sort index can be determined, See test/order.
+ auto-<sweep>ing is now supported: if no <filter> is provided for a <sweep>,
  the sweep will be performed across all distinct content of this parameter.
 (see queries 3 and 4 in test/sweep)
x issue #6 (problems with default values for input in complex setups)
x info: default content "NULL" is now also shown
~ input: list ALL values which have missing definitions at once
+ new feature "parameter sets" helps to manage static parameters for series
  of runs in an identical envrionment. See test/pset for usage information.
  Used via the input command (switches "--pset-store" and "--pset-use")
+ info command knows about parameter sets and can list their names and
  the content of an individual parameter set
~ database version is now at '3', check command can update existing
  experiments
+ ls command can now list the distinct content for a parameter or result
  value or meta information (switch --distinct)
~ info command sorts and structures the "verbose" output of parameters
  and results better
x fixed the automatic unit conversion when using the scale operator
  with scale prefixes (like 'value="Mega"')
~ made the filename-unification <filename unify="filter"> more clever
  when <sweep>s are used: duplicate filter strings are only added once
  to the filename
x fixed problem (wrong label) when using more than one "open"
  parameter filter
+ added new option "default" to the "--missing" argument of the input
  command which allows to use the combination "ask for value content that
  is not contained in the input description, and use default content for
  values that are contained, but for which no data is found in the input file."

RELEASE 0.7.1 (Mon, 29 Aug 2005)
+ new test 'exist' which tests import of duplicate files
+ target 'clean' to all Makefiles of the test suite
+ 'info' command can now sort the output when listing all experiments
  of a database
+ 'info' command can now filter the experiments listing by the
  name of the creator
+ 'info' command can now filter the experiments listing by the
  access rights of one or more users
~ 'delete' command with --force option exits silently if the experiment
  to be deleted does not exist.
+ new target 'dbclean' in testsuite Makefiles removes stray test experiments
~ distrib-operator generates "number of samples" as additional parameter 'N_samples'
  which is i.e. shown in charts
- some code cleanup
- some output has changed, test suite was adapted accordingly
+ perfbase can now handle trace files, too (in a way); added required
  functionality and a new examples (slog2) for this application
x fixed exception for "distrib" operator with no data
+ added mode="accumulate" to input via <named_location>
+~ Automatically (or explicitely) use the second x/y axis when plotting
  different types of data into a single chart. The difference between the
  data is determined by its physical unit.
  For an example query, see examples/mpptest/mpptest_query_dual.xml

RELEASE 0.7.0 (Mon, 29 Aug 2005)
- initial public release
