This example shows how perfbase can be used to store the
per-process information that NEC MPI/SX can create for every
MPI application.

To have MPI/SX create this information, you need to set the
environment variable MPIPROGINF to ALL_DETAIL, like

export MPIPROGINF=ALL_DETAIL

perfbase than stores the per-process information. The accumulated
data that MPI/SX does also print is *not* stored as it can be calculated
using perfbase.
