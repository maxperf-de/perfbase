This directory contains the auto-comparison framework for the "NAS Parallel
Benchmarks" (NPB). 
auto-npb_exp.xml: experiment description. For clarity, it does not contain any
                  machine/platform-describing parameter values which you normally 
                  would include. Add them as necessary.

auto-npb_input.xml: input description that parses the output of any NPB benchmark.

comparison_qry.xml: compare the NPB performance of two software/hardware 
                    platforms. Creates a plot and stores the same data in 
                    a text file.
analyse:      shell script that performs the analysis
SGE:          containes a batch file for job submission on a SunGridengine-based
              cluster.

[ Set up the experiment. ]
perfbase setup -d auto-npb_exp.xml

[ Import the data. The test have been executed on a 16-node, dual-socket dual-core
  Opteron cluster with Infiniband interconnect, using the Intel 9.1 compiler. ]
perfbase input -d auto-npb_input.xml input/MPI-*/*.out

[ Run the analysis. This example provides data for the LU and FT benchmarks. ]
./analyse

[ Look at the graphical results which are stored as postscript documents. Here,
  we use 'gv' to display them. The documents contain two pages
  The first page shows the performance difference between the NPB execution with MPI 
  implemenation A and B, expressed as the decrease/increase of performance A relative 
  to the performance of B. Only differences exceeding the chosen threshold are shown.
  The second page displays the absolute performance number for both MPI implementations
  and all topologies (1, 2 and 4 processes pe node). ]
gv NPB_FT_ALL.ps
gv NPB_LU_ALL.ps

[ The same data is also available as text files (.dat suffix). The NPB_full*.dat files 
  contain the absolute performance numbers, while the NPB_*_comparison*.dat files show
  the relative performance of A vs. B. I.e.:]
cat NPB_full_FT_class_C_1_processes_per_node_B_A.dat
cat NPB_LU_comparison.dat
