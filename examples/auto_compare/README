'auto_compare' is a small "framework" for (semi-)automatic performance
comparison based on perfbase. After you have performed a number of tests
that cover your test parameter space, this framework will help you to 
quickly determine for which parameter set the performance is best, or worse.

Getting this information manually from a large set of result file, or even
from perfbase query results, is not necessarily a trivial task, depending 
on how much results a test creates. In this example, we process results of
PMB, a MPI benchmark now known as IMB (Intel MPI Benchmark).
