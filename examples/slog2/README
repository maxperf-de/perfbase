This example illustrates how perfbase can be used to process data from
trace files. In this case, we have traced an MPI application with MPE2
(from MPICH2) which gives us a clog file. This can be converted into
an slog2 file. We can generate an text-based representation of this 
binary slog2 file (which is included as sendmany_trace.slog2) using 
the 'slog2print' tool. This gives us sendmany_trace.slog2.txt, which
we can process with perfbase.

To run the DEMO, do:

perfbase setup -d slog2_exp.xml

perfbase input -d slog2_input.xml -f N_ppn=1,N_node=2 sendmany_trace.slog2.txt

perfbase query -d slog2_query_barrier-latency.xml

This gives the average and standard deviation of all calls to MPI_Barrier()
for process 0 and 1.

Finally, delete the experiment via

perfbase delete -e slog2_DEMO


NOTE: This capability was added to perfbase just recently and thus may 
      need more testing and improvement.
